# Botnet-blogpost
This repo basically contains the code that was mentioned in the blogposts that was written by me:

Part 1: http://niiconsulting.com/checkmate/2018/02/malware-development-welcome-dark-side-part-1/


Part 2:
    2-1. http://niiconsulting.com/checkmate/2018/02/malware-development-welcome-dark-side-part-2-1/
    2-2. http://niiconsulting.com/checkmate/2018/02/malware-development-welcome-dark-side-part-2-2/

All the malware code and the Botnet server code will be hosted here. Be kind as not to upload the signature to virustotal, which will only help to keep the signature unknown and keep it undetected.
